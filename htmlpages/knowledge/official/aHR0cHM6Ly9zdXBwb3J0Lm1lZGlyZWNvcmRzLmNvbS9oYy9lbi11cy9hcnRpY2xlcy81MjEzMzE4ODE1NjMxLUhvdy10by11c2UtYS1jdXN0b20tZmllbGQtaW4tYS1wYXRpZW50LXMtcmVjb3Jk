As options for customisation expand with future releases, Custom Fields will become part of a premium feature bundle for users who want to harness business-specific data capturing within MediRecords. Pricing will be announced when the full feature is available.\n  1. To use a custom field, navigate to a patient's record. \n  2. Click the Details tab, then click Additional. Any active Custom Fields you had set up in the Configuration section will appear here.\n    4. Enter in any desired information you wish to record.
