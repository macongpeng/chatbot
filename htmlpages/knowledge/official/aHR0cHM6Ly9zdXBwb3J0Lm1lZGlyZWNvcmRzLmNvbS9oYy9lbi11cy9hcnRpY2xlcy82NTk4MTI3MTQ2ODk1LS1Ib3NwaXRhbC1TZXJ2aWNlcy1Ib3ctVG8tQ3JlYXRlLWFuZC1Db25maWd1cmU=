These agreements are designed to ensure that patients who are members of the health fund can receive medical treatment from the hospital or medical group at a reduced cost, or with no out-of-pocket expenses.\nThe Hospital Purchaser Provider Agreement (HPPA) or Provider Agreement (PA) is an agreement between the hospital and the private health fund. This agreement outlines the services that the hospital will provide to the health fund's members, as well as the payment arrangements and other terms and conditions of the agreement.\nThe Medical Purchaser Provider Agreement (MPPA) is a similar agreement, but it is between the medical provider (such as a diagnostic service provider or hospital) and the private health fund. This agreement sets out the terms under which the provider will offer their services to the health fund's members, including the fees that will be charged and any limitations or exclusions that may apply.\nSchemes \nHealthcare providers directly enroll with a private health insurance (PHI) company. Under such programs, there are two types of coverage options: No Gap and Known Gap cover.\nNo Gap - Patients do not have any out-of-pocket expenses for the healthcare services provided by the enrolled provider. This means that the insurance company will cover the entire cost of the treatment.\nKnown Gap - This means that patients have an out-of-pocket expense for the healthcare services provided by the enrolled provider. In this case, the provider is required to provide written Informed Financial Consent, which explains the cost of the treatment and any out-of-pocket expenses that the patient will be responsible for. The insurance company will cover a portion of the cost, and the patient will be responsible for paying the remaining amount.\nPatient Claim\nThis is where the patient will pay for the services provider and will claim back from the PHI themselves. \nA full detailed receipt of services and provider numbers are given to the patient to enable them to claim back the funds from the PHI, according to their PHI policy.\nAGC\nAccess Gap Cover (AGC) is a private health insurance option that can help you reduce or eliminate the out-of-pocket expenses, also known as the gap, for medical services you receive in the hospital.\n  What is a Fund Payee ID?\nPrivate health insurers issue their own unique identification numbers to healthcare providers for streamlining the payment of claims."}
