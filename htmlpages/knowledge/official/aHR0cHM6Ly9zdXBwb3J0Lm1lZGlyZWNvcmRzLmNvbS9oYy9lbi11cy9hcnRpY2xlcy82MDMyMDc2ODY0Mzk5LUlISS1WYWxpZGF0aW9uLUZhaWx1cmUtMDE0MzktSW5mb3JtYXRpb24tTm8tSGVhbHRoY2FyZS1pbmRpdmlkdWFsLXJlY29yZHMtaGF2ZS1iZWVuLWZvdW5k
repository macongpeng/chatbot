{"title": "IHI Validation Failure: '01439'(Information) No Healthcare individual records have been found'", "body": "Validating the individual healthcare identifier (the \u2018IHI\u2019) and accessing the My Health\nRecord System possesses a higher level of security than an OPV (Online Patient Verification)\ncheck for Medicare. As such, it is essential that the organisation has the most accurate\nand up-to-date patient demographic information, because without that information an\nIHI may not be validated.\n\nPatients can call the Healthcare Identifiers Service on 1300 361 457 Monday to Friday 8:30 am to 5 pm AEST to check their details against what they have provided the Practice."}
