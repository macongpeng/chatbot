So, how does it work?\nGetting Started\nFor Co-Browse to work, ensure you:\nLogged into your MediRecords account with your own unique set of credentials\nProvide support with your full name and suitable time to connect\nBe in front of your MediRecords account at the agreed co-browse time\nHow does it work?\nAt the agreed time, a MediRecords support agent will send you a co-browse request that will appear on your MediRecords screen.\nStep 1. MediRecords support will send you a request to connect (Note: Co-Browse session will not begin without the expressed authority of the user).\nStep 2. A pop up will appear on your MR screen, awaiting your response:\nStep 3.

The agent will be able to:\n1. \nHighlight an area on your MediRecords screen\n2.\nDraw temporary arrows and write \"handwritten\" instructions that will appear briefly on your screen as required\n      As you are always in control, you can end session at any time by selecting END SESSION located in the bottom left corner of your screen.\nOnce the session has ended you will receive a pop-up notification to confirm the session has ended, just like the one below:\n  You've completed another MediRecords Tutorial.
