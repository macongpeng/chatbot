As such, it is essential that the organisation has the most accurate\nand up-to-date patient demographic information, because without that information an\nIHI may not be validated.\n\nPatients can call the Healthcare Identifiers Service on 1300 361 457 Monday to Friday 8:30 am to 5 pm AEST to check their details against what they have provided the Practice."}
