{"title": "Nominated 'Pharmacy Field' when Prescribing", "body": "The \"Pharmacy\" field as shown in the screenshot below, allows the user to include the name of their preferred pharmacy intended for dispensing.\nCurrently, this value is only required by New South Wales legislation in very specific circumstances, and the field is hidden when prescribing from any state that is NOT NSW.\nThis field makes no change to the actual script.  Although the name of the nominated pharmacy is reflected on the script, this, however, does not stop the patient from having the script filled elsewhere.\nSelecting this field does not automatically send a copy of the script to the Nominated Pharmacy, it simply indicates the name of the pharmacy preferred by the user to the national script exchange.\nThe Pharmacy field uses a Contact Service Provider dropdown, filtered by service type pharmacy. To add a pharmacy it must first exist in the tenants' contact book.\nPlease follow this link to create a New Service Provider Contact: \nCreating a New Service Provider Contact\n   "}
