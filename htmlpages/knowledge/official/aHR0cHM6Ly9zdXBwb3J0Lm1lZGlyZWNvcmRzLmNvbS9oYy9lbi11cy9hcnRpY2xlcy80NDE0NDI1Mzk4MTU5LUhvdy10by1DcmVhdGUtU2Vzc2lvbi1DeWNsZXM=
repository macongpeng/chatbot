{"title": "How to Create Session Cycles", "body": "This article will walk you through how to create Sessions using the Cycle function in MediRecords. The Cycle function works when a Provider has somewhat of an irregular schedule each week. This allows Providers to create sessions that are re-occurring but only occur on certain allocated weeks. \n\nCycle meaning: When you are choosing your cycle period you will need to confirm if the Provider is on a fortnightly schedule or if are on a monthly schedule (do they have 2 weeks of different hours each week OR do they have 4 weeks of different hours each week)\n\nFor example, you have a Provider who has a 2 week rotating schedule. \nWeek 1: Works Monday -Thursday 8AM - 6PM, and Friday 8AM - 1PM.\nWeek 2: Works Mon - Friday 7 AM - 4 PM, and Saturday 8 AM - 2 PM.\n\nThese sessions will repeat itself until specified.\nIf you are unsure of how-to create sessions please follow How do I create a Session to learn.\n1. When you are viewing the Sessions via More > Settings > Appointments > Select appropriate Practice > Sessions > Select New Session.\n2. Within the new Regular Session window enter all of the appropriate fields as you normally would when you create a session. \n3. At number 6 enter in the Cycle period you wish to create (for example, if the Provider's schedule changes fortnightly then you will enter in Cycle 1 of 2 OR if it changes weekly you will enter 1 of 4.)\n4. The Cycle start date is when you want this particular cycle to start. (for example, Cycle 1 of 2 will start on 31/01/2022 so then, Cycle 2 of 2 will start on 07/02/2022.) \nBelow is an example of creating a Session Cycle for a 2-week rotating roster\n\nHot Tip: If a Provider works Mon-Friday set hours one week and different set hours the next you can create a session cycle for Mon-Saturday and then just delete the session created for Saturday instead of creating a session or each individual day: \n\nThe First Session cycle. (Week 1)\n\nDelete Session/s that are extras and not needed.\n\nThe second Session Cycle. (Week 2)\n\nYou have successfully completed another MediRecords Tutorial. "}
