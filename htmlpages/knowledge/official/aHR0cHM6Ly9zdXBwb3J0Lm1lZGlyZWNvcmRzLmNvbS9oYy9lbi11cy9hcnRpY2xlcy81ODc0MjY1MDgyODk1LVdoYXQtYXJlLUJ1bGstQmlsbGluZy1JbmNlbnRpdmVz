{"title": "What are Bulk Billing Incentives", "body": "The Bulk Billing Incentives program is run by Medicare and compensates providers when they bulk bill. The amount of compensation depends on the provider's location. \n  Practice Location\nMBS uses the Modified Monash Model (MMM) which defines if a location is a city, rural, remote, or very remote area. The model then categorises the location between MM 1 to MM 7. \nMM 1 is a location within a major city.
