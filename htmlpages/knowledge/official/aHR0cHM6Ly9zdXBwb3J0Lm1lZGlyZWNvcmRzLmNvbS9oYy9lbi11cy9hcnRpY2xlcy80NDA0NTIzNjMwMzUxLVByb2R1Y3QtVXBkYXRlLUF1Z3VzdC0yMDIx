Below you will find a summary of each of the changes we have made. \n  Increased File Size Upload Limit\nThe file size limit has been increased across MediRecords, to allow you to upload larger file sizes up to 20MB. This change affects the following areas within MediRecords:\nClinical Drawings (Patient Clinical & Resources)\nPatient Clinical - New Correspondence In\nPatient Clinical - Correspondence Out (imported documents)\nSecure Messaging Inbox\nSecure Messaging Outbox\nInvestigation Results\nBulk Scan Upload\nReferrals\n  Provider Number Added to Health Professionals Grid\nYou may now view the provider number for a contact from within the Health Professionals grid within Resources. \n  Interested Parties & Usual GP Mail Merge Fields Added\nNew mail merge fields have been added to the letter editor, so you may now import a patient's Interested Parties and Usual GP directly from the patient's record. These fields are found within the Patient table when editing a template or letter. When using these fields, the following will occur:\nInterested Parties:\nThe Provider's name and Provider Number will be imported (if recorded against the Contact record).\nThe Category of Referrer will display if the party were recorded in the Referral section in Patient Details.\nAny notes recorded for the Interested Parties will be displayed in the Details field.\nUsual GP:\nThe Interested Party marked as the patient's Usual GP in their Interested Parties will be displayed.\n  Search by Provider Number on Health Professionals Grid\nYou may now search by a provider by entering their provider number into the search bar available at the top of the Health Professionals grid. Results will be returned when you have entered a minimum of 3 characters from the beginning of the provider number. \n  Stickiness Implemented in Contacts Area\nWhen searching in the Health Professionals or Service Provider grids, you will no longer lose your search term after opening and closing a record. This assists with finding the correct contact record where a contact may have multiple records for different locations.\n  Stickiness in Filters Applied for Tasks/Activities\nWhen applying filters within the Tasks/Activities window, you will now be able to apply separate filters for each patient.\n  Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21) EPC Template Added\nThe DASS21 form is now available as an EPC template within the consultation window. Answering the questions will provide a scoring for each category, and an overall scoring with appropriate diagnosis.\n  Chronological Appointment Agenda View\nThe Agenda view in Appointments will now display all appointments in chronological order, rather than grouping the appointments by provider. This improvement aims to improve the Agenda's usefulness when looking to see the appointments booked for a certain patient, or provider."}
