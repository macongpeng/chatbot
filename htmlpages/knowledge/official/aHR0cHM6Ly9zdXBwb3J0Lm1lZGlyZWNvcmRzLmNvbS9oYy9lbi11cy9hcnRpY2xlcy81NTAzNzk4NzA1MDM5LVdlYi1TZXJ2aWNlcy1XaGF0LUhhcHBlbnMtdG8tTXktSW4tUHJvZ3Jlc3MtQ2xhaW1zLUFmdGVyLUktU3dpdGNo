{"title": "Web Services - What Happens to My In Progress Claims After I Switch?", "body": "Don't fret! Any claims that are submitted, but not yet Completed, prior to your switch will still be able to retrieve Process and Payment reports, even if you switch while they are still In Progress. \nYou do not need to pause or stagger your Claiming in order to make the switch to the PRODA device. MediRecords has implemented the required changes to ensure there is no interruption to your Claiming functions. \nOnce you have switched to the PRODA device, your claims will begin to be transmitted via the new Web Services PRODA device, and no longer use the old PKI Certificate.
