{"title": "Patient Views explained", "body": "Views are data filters which screen your MediRecords patient database to produce a list that matches the criteria. This article will provide a brief overview of the feature.\nAny field within a patient's medical record that is populated with data can be used to refine the list of patients within your Custom View. This makes it an incredibly useful tool in screening your patients for certain criteria e.g. age. The list of patients you can see on the Patients homepage can be filtered by creating and saving personalised Views of patient records. Due to this customisability, Views will vary from user to user.\n  Please check out the following articles on how to create, edit and delete views.\nCreating Patient Views\nEditing Patient Views\nDeleting Patient Views"}
