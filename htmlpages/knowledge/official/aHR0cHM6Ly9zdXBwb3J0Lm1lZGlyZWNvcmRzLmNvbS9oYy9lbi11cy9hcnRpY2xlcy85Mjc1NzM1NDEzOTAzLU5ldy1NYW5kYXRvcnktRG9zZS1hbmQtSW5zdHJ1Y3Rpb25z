{"title": "New Mandatory Dose and Instructions", "body": "The Australia Digital Health Agency (ADHA) now requires the 'dose' field to contain a value when e-prescribing. This change has been made as part of their 3.0 e-prescribing conformance.\n  The National script exchange will no longer accept scripts that do not contain values within the Dose and Instruction fields, as such both fields are now mandatory. Users will be unable to progress to the third prescribing page without nominating both a dose and an instruction. \n  When prescribing it is now mandatory to enter a dose in the dose field, this also applies to your complex instructions, you will still be required to make an entry in the dose field.
