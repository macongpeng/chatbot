{"title": "Medicare Error - The details in this claim are inconsistent with the service called - Specialist Service...", "body": "The requirements when sending electronic claims to Medicare, DVA and Health Funds are now stricter with Web Services, so you may find you receive an error message if you try to send a claim which hasn't met all the requirements.\n\nThe good thing about Web Services is that a detailed error from Medicare will be displayed on the screen, indicating what details they need you to provide on the invoice.\n  If you receive the below message, it indicates that your provider is set to the Specialist Medicare Provider Type*, and that a diagnostic request, referral, referral override code, or self deemed code, have not been set against at least one of the services in the invoice.\n\n  Make sure you have the required details added to the invoice, before trying to claim it again.\n\n\nFor more information about adding a diagnostic request to an invoice, please see this article.\n\nIf you've added a referral to the invoice but are still receiving an error, please see this article.\n\n*If you're unsure what Medicare Provider Type your provider is set to, take a look at the Invoices section, in their configuration. \n "}
