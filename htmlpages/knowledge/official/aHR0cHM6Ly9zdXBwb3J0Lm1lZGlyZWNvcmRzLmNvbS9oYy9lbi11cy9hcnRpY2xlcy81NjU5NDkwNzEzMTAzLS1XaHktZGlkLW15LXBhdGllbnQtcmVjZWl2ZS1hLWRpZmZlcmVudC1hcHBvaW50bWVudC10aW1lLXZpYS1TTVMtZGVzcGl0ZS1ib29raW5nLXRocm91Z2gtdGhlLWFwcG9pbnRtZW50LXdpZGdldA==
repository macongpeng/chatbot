{"title": "Why did my patient receive a different appointment time via SMS despite booking through the appointment widget?", "body": "There are instances that patients receive the wrong time of appointment on the SMS confirmation compared to what they originally booked.\nThis happens when a patient books their appointment via the appointment widget.\nIf the patient time zone is available, then the patient's time zone is used, however, a patient can only set their time zone if they have signed up through the MediRecords Mobile App. The patient's address is not used to determine their time zone.\nIf the patient's time zone is unavailable, (in some cases because the patient doesn't have the MediRecords Mobile App and cannot set their time zone), then the SMS appointment confirmation sent is in the provider's time zone. If the provider's time zone is unavailable, then the appointment time that will show in the SMS appointment confirmation will be in the AEST time zone by default.\nWe highly recommend to patients that they use and sign up for the MediRecords Mobile App to ensure they receive their appointment confirmation in their correct time zone.\nAside from that, they can view their medication, appointments, and medical records from the patient mobile app.\nPatient App FAQs"}
