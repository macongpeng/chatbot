{"title": "Resource Share Types & Who Can Manage", "body": "Resource Share Types & Who Can Manage\n  With any resource that is in MediRecords, the privacy setting, i.e. who has access to it, is specified as the Share Type. This article will provide an explanation of this feature, along with who can manage it.\nShare types have three categories:\nPrivate\n\nThe resource is available only to you.\n\nPractice\n\nThe resource is available to all users within the practice.\n\nCommunity\n\nThe resource is available to all MediRecords users, regardless of practice.\n\nA fourth category known as Global Contacts exists in Service Providers. It is virtually similar to Community in terms of privacy level.\n  Who Can Manage Resources?\n\nAccess to the Resources section is dictated by your subscription plan.\n\nThe Filter function in each category of Resources will allow you to selectively view resources based on their Share type. We will demonstrate with the Letter Templates section.\n\n1. Click on More and select Resources.\n\n  2. Select Letter Templates.\n\n  3. Click on Filter. You will see the following options on the menu.\n\n  4. Click on Practice.\n\n  5. Checking the boxes next to the template will allow you to edit.\n\n\n\nNeed assistance, please contact MediRecords support on 1300 103 903 during business hours OR email support@medirecords.com"}
