There are four 'Doughnut' style graphs on the dashboard that reflect your Total Outstanding, 0-30 Days Past Due, 30-60 Days Past Due, and 60+ Days Past Due invoices. Similar to the Claiming dashboard, the graphs are color-coded to represent the type of Payer on the invoices (e.g. Blue represents Medicare).\n \nYou can filter the list of invoices by payer, by clicking on the corresponding colour on the doughnut graph. For example, if you want to view open invoices where the payer is a patient, click the Amber section of the doughnut.\n \nTo restore the list of invoices to display all open invoices, click the $ value in the middle of the doughnut.\nTo search for an outstanding invoice, click the Search box and type in a Keyword from the Name (first, last, or full), Invoice No., Payer, or Provider. Press Enter and the system will display a list of the closest matches.\n \nYou will notice that there are three functions: New Invoice, Receive Payment, and Provide Quote. These are accessible regardless of the graph you have clicked.\n  New Invoice \nTo create a new invoice, click New Invoice. You will have two options: New Invoice and New Multiple Patient Invoice.\n\nIf you select New Invoice, follow the same steps as detailed in the Patient Billing article/s.\nIf you select New Multiple Patient Invoice, you will be given the following screen.

You can also search for a provider by typing in the keyword or first and last name in the search bar.\n                                                      Export Information\nTo export information from the sales screen, click on the Export button located under the Receive Payment button.
