To help you through this process, we have written this step-by-step setup guide.\n  Services Australia recently introduced Web Services to replace the existing \"Server Adaptor\" technology which had been in use for some time.\nThis is a newer technology that allows users to securely share data with various Services Australia entities.\nAuthentication will verify an individual's identity and organization against the Australian Business Register via a highly secure system called Provider Digital Access (PRODA). PRODA provides a higher level of security than PKI certificates and is fully digital and portable across web-enabled devices. \nThis means that organisations will no longer need to apply for and maintain a PKI certificate, and MediRecords will host and maintain a 'Vendor PRODA Device' on a server level.\n  New Providers will need to continue to ensure that an HW052 form is completed and processed before claiming to link the Provider number to the Minor Site ID. \nFor more information on how to Locate Minor Site ID click here.\n  The steps below will cover how to set up the Health Identifiers service for connecting to My Health Record and eRx for e-Prescribing.\nPrerequisites you will need:\nHPI-O number - NASH Certificate (fac_sign.p12)\n Provider HPI-I numbers \neRx ID\u2019s for individual providers\n Register your organisation in the HI Service to obtain an HPI-O number and apply for a NASH Certificate. Click here to see how to apply.\nYou will need the NASH Certificate in the form of a P12 file, as well as the Personal Identification Code (PIC)\nObtain a copy of all your provider's HPI-I numbers.\nNote: If you cannot locate your doctor's HPI-I number, they can contact either HPOS or APHRA to obtain a copy of their 16-digit HPI-I number.\nBefore you can set up eRx in MediRecords, you will need to register for e-prescribing on the eRx website. To register, go here and click Register NOW in the right-hand corner of the page.\nOnce eRx has sent you the unique eRx ID\u2019s per provider, you can begin configuring.\n  Here is a list of final steps you need complete within the MediRecords platform, It is important that you complete these steps in the order that they appear.\nIntroduction to Security Roles Security Role Security roles\nAssign Provider and Prescriber No.'s Provider & Prescriber No:\nInvestigations Templates  Letter Templates\nUser Configuration and Preferences  Configuration & Preferences\nAppointment Calendar Settings  Appointment Calendar Settings \nBanking and Accounts Bank Accounts\nMedicare Claiming Medicare Claiming\nBilling Settings Billing Settings\nFee Schedules Fee Schedules\nOnce you have completed these steps, you will be ready to migrate your data and patient records from your old system into MediRecords.
