This means situations where a patient does not have a Medicare card (such as some DVA card holders), are not able to have their claims sent electronically to a health fund (IMC). \n \n\nIf you have received this error because you are attempting to bill a DVA patient with in-patient services to their health fund, we recommend contacting the DVA provider invoicing and billing enquiries help line on 1300 550 017 for guidance.\n\nIf instead you need to send the invoice to the health fund manually, please follow the steps in this article."}
