This is for drugs of dependence / incapable patients. \nIf a Send Script to Pharmacy value is set, the patient will NOT receive a copy of the token, the token will NOT be made available on the patient's active script list and there is no automatic mechanism for the script exchange to make the script available to the pharmacy.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the prescriber to ensure that a copy of the evidence of the prescription makes its way to the pharmacy. MediRecords will not automatically send this to the pharmacy\n \n\nNote: when a send to pharmacy value has been set, submit to active script list is locked to No and a confirm patient email address or mobile number modal will NOT populate upon prescribing.
