The amount of compensation depends on the provider's location. \n  Practice Location\nMBS uses the Modified Monash Model (MMM) which defines if a location is a city, rural, remote, or very remote area. The model then categorises the location between MM 1 to MM 7. \nMM 1 is a location within a major city. Only practices categorised between MM 2 to MM 7 are eligible for the Bulk Billing Incentives. \nThe MMM is classified using the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) which can be found here. \nClick here to access Medicare's website where they define the different MM locations and which item numbers you need to use.\nIf you are eligible and wish to claim using the Bulk Billing Incentives click here to access an article on how to turn this feature on in MediRecords\n  Patients Eligibility \nDoctors are only able to access Bulk Billing Incentives if their clinic and the patient are both eligible.
