The data element does not comply with the values permitted or has failed a check digit check.\nThere are discrepancies with the data being sent to Medicare for that claim, which may be due to patient details (e.g. address), the provider (e.g. provider number), and/or the item number(s) submitted. Please check all details and ensure no miscellaneous characters are used.\nWe recommend reviewing the patient's Records for any characters and removing them. Also, re-entering the patient's details manually could assist with removing any extra spaces or foreign characters that may have been created by copying and pasting the details from an external source."}
