Once created, you can manage, edit, delete or change the sharing permissions of anything you have created.\nTo access your protocols and recipes, open the Resources page (click More -> Resources) and click Drugs.\nRecipes\nThere are three types of recipes - Private, Practice and Community.\nPrivate recipes are created by clinicians for private use only, and will only be available to the user that created them. Practice recipes, which have been created by local users at the clinic, are shared with, and available to all users at their practice. Community recipes are created by MediRecords users that actively contribute to, and share clinical information with the MediRecords community. Recipes shared with the community are available to all clinicians and practices using MediRecords. \nBy default, the Recipes page displays a summary of all recipes that are available for you to use. The summary includes recipes that are private, shared with your practice or the MediRecords community. From the summary page, you can quickly view the recipe Name, Form, Quantity, Restriction, Repeats, Share level, Rating and Status, and who the protocol was Created By.\n  Creating a New Recipe\n "}
